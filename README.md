# CS086 Project 2: Enhancing the Vending Machine
## Introduction
In this project, you will design and enhance the simple vending machine that you made for project 1.  The project goals are as follows:  
1. Further refine your programming skills.  Can you save code by using polymorephism?  
2. Use common data structures and search algorithms in a working example.  
3. Learn more about development collaboration and your classmates

## Project Description
Merge the two-person group from project 1 with another group of your choice for a 4 person team.  Develop a team name.  Brainstorm and design one enhancement to add to the project 1 vending machine.  As a group implement the enhacenemnt into the basic vending machine project; suggest selecting one group member's project 1 and adding the feature to that codebase instead of trying to merge multiple baselines together.  However, the choice is yours.  

The two design and implementation requirements are as follows:  
1. use at least one of the data structures from CS086.  You may review future slides and select the appropriate one.  
2. use at least one of the search algorithms from CS086. You may review future slides and select the appropriate one.


### Strategy
For my development environment, I use [MS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on Windows with [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and the Ubuntu LTS.  I rely on [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/index.html) in order to manage python libraries and set the python version.  There are many different ways to implement.  If you make an assumption, state it in the comments.  If you used a tutorial or found code online, add the reference location in the comments. Your program should provide basic error checking.  Review the [python 3.10 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.10/). Installing the VSCode extension, [LiveShare](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack), may also be helpful for collaboration.

### Submission Instructions
1. Create a github project that has the following:  
    1. readme with instructions on how to run the program, dependencies, assumptions, a brief description of the enhacement the group chose to implement, the members of the group, and the group name.  Include some group-introspection on how the team did, what challenges has to be overcome, how were roles divided, and the group/project name.
    2. sample input: the dataset you used for your program
    3. the source code  
    4. A short video showing your program accpeting input and producing the results. 

    _If you choose to make your repo private, then add my github username as a collaborator_

2. Submit the github https link in MS Teams so that I can pull down your repo by running:   

    git clone https...
